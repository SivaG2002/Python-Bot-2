This bot is build in replit which offer various tools for making the bot.

Replit --> https://replit.com/

The main disadvantage of using other IDE is that i doesn't hide your privacy content like bot tokens... 

  
I use replit instead of IDE because it offers hiding of privacy content in our code for example (Discord Bot Token)
